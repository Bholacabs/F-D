1. What is ternary operator?
1. Ternary means three (3) , it is single line alternative of if_else statement.
   
   First(1st) is condition.
   Second(2nd) is if (true) statement.
   Third(3rd) is else (false) statement.
   
   Syntax: 
           condition()? true statement : false statement;

*2. What is function (defination) function call , function parameters/arguments ?
 2. Block/Chunk of code we can use again and again without writing it multiple times.
    Functions breaks a problem into into smaller parts , each part has a specific 
    task. 
    Advantages : Reusability, understandable,....
    
    A function call is an expression that passes control and arguments (if any) to a 
    function and has the form: expression (expression-list) where expression is a 
    function name or evaluates to a function address and expression-list is a list of
    expressions (separated by commas).
    
    Information can be passed to functions as a parameter. Parameters act as variables 
    inside the function.
    
    This information we send to a funciton during function call is called an argument.
    

3. What is syntax of functions in JS and how to store a function in a variable?
3. A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
   A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
   
   Syntax:   
          function name (parameter1,parameter2.....)
          {
          //code
          }

   e.g.function square(int n)
       {
        return n*n;
       }

   We can store function in a variable:
   
   var x= function()
   {
     return a+b;
   }
   console.log( x(10,20) ); // called it using x 
   
4. What are arrow functions?
4. It allows us to use shorter function syntax.
   e.g. let add = (a,b) => a+b;
   
   You can remove { } and "return" keyword.
   e.g. hello = () => return "Hello";
   This works for one statement functions
   const hello = (val) => "Hello" +val;
   In above e.g. you can skip ( ) of parameter (if one parameter is there)
   const hello = val => "Hello" +val ;
   

5. Use function in one line to add 2 numbers in JS?
5. Use arrow function:
   
   const add2 = (a,b) => a+b;
