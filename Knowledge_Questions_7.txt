1. What is an object?
1. Objects contain data and code. Data in form of fields (data fields) and code in form 
   of procedures. We can modify the object's data fields.
   Object has properties and functions. We can change , add , delete properties to an 
   object.



2. What is object in JS?
2. It is collection of named values (name:value).
   It is good practice in JS to declare an object with "const" keyword. 

3. How to make an Object in JS?
3. There are 4 ways to make an object in JS:
   
   a) Using an Object literal:
     
     You define and create an object in one statement:
     const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};   
     
     const person = {
     firstName: "John",
     lastName: "Doe",
     age: 50,
     eyeColor: "blue"};
     
     const person = {};
     person.firstName = "John";
     person.lastName = "Doe";
     person.age = 50;
     person.eyeColor = "blue";
     
   b) Using "new object()" keyword: 
     
     const human= new object();
     human.eyecolor:blue;
     human.age=30;
   
   c)Define an object constructor, and then create objects of the constructed type.
  
   d)Create an object using Object.create().

   For readability, simplicity and execution speed, use the object literal method.

4. Are objects in JS mutable?
4. Yes , JS objects are mutable .
   
   They are addressed by reference and not by value.
   If const x=person;
   Then x will not a copy of person . Both x and person are same objects and Changes
   in x will also change person.
 
   const person = {
   firstName:"John",
   lastName:"Doe",
   age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};
   
   const x = person;
   x.age = 10;      // Will change both x.age and person.age
